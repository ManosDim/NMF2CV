This was a mini-project for the Sound Analysis course of my masterâ€™s. So far, the patch 
has been tested with the BEAP abstraction in MAX, and with my modular system using 
only the time activations as CV to the ADDAC 106 eurorack module. Fluid CorpusManipulation Toolkit for Max needs to be installed.
